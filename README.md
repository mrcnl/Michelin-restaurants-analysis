# michelin-restaurants-analysis
In-depth analysis of data on restaurants that got awarded with Michelin star(s)

The subject of this notebook is the analysis of restaurants that can pride themselves on a star (or stars) awarded by Michelin. The dataset is downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/jackywang529/michelin-restaurants and it is divided into three csv files. Each of them shows the restaurants (and their details) which were awarded with one, two and three stars respectively.

It is necessary to announce that the dataset does not contain the list of all of the restaurants with Michelin star. In the list there are no restauarants that are located i.a. in Germany, Spain or Italy.
